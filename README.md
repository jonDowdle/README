# About Me

Hello! Let's start with introductions first, I prefer to be called "Jon".
It's nice to meet you. I am currently working as an Engineering Manager
within Ops at https://RallyHealth.com

## Working Together

*This is mostly if we're co-workers of any fashion.*

I'm glad we get the chance to work together. No matter where you are in the
company, I am happy to meet and chat about many things. Along with other
members of Ops, I have office hours here Rally Ops Office Hours but I'm also
happy to meet at times that are free on my calendar, I'll decline if for any
reason I can't attend.

## Prefer Asynchronous

In all but the most time sensitive circumstances, I prefer asynchronous
communication to synchronous. What does that look like?

* Give written feedback vs. a verbal response to a written document.
* Write ideas down first, even if informally.
* Ask a question on Stack Overflow vs in Slack (yes chat is async to a degree 
  but it requires more immediacy).

## Meetings (aka synchronous)

I prefer meetings in which we are using the precious time to discuss and
converse topics that might be too nuanced or complicated to write down at that
moment. To optimize for that, I highly prefer that meetings have a few things:

1. An agenda. If you can't enumerate the list of topics for us to discuss, it's
   unlikely we'll use the time wisely. Without this, I might decline your
   meeting on the face of it. Note: An agenda doesn't need to be 10 bullet
   points, one is fine in some circumstances.
2. Prep work called out in the invite. A few common examples of this would be
   * if there's something you'd like me to read and give feedback on, please 
    note that a head of time.
   * if there's a deliverable for you, please give appropriate time for me to 
    accomplish that and send back to you so that you have time to review prior 
    to the meeting time.
3. Appropriate times. Most calendar systems default meetings to 30 or 60 
   minutes. There's a small chance your agenda is going to fit those timeframes 
   exactly. Start smaller than necessary. Given the prior 2 points, meetings 
   will be faster than you expect. We can always have another one to continue 
   the conversation.

## One on Ones (O3s or 1x1)

If you're a direct report of mine, expect to have a one on one or O3 with me 
every week. This meeting is for you and roughly is about the topics you'd like 
to discuss. I'll bring up anything I'd like to discuss at the end. The things 
we talk about don't need to be task or project focused. The typical format for 
our O3s will be 15 minutes for you, 15 minutes for me. The schedule is flexible 
and won't always be typical. If there is feedback to be given to you, I will 
ask you "Can I give you some feedback?" and you can say "No". Also a footnote 
to feedback, it's often times positive.
